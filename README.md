RESTful API Example
========================

I found it difficult to find a consolidated example
for putting together a whole bunch of technologies to setup
a RESTful api working with an ember.js app.  So I'm putting this together.

Here are the technologies I'm using:

*Server Side*
-Node.js
-Express
-Mongodb
-Step (used to organize processing)

*Client Side*
-Ember.js
-JQuery (used by ember.js)
-Handlebars (used by ember.js)
-Ember-data
-Showdown (for safe HTML)
-Moment (for date functions)
